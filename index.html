        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  Hello, my name is Reza. I enjoy playing video games and strategic board games like Minecraft, Hollow Knight, and Chess. I have a general interest in technology and am interested in programming due to the ways that it can improve things like one's desktop experience and overall performance among other things. I also have an interest in Japanese history and things like Star Wars lore and Transformers.</p>
