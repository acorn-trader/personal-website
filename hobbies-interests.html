        <h2>Chess</h2>

        <h2>Legos</h2>
        <p>I enjoy creating things using legos. These creations are generally based off of things that I like, such as Star Wars, Transformers, and the SCP Foundation. I enjoy researching things on samurai as I have a fascination for samurai especially things like their armor and weapons.</p>
